To demonstrate the skillsets I developed in VIS 2128, I have applied each of the skillsets to a Canadian context.

This portfolio demonstrates the following skills:
* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Converting between raster layers and vector layers (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Displaying raster data on a map (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Georeferencing a raster image (see Maps # [add hyperlink])
* Displaying data on an interactive map (see Maps # [add hyperlink])

# Maps of Boston
Here are two maps of Boston. I might include some text here about this set of maps.
